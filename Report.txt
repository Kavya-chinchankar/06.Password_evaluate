# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 🧩 Objective
To understand what makes a password strong, create passwords of varying complexity, test them using online password strength checkers, and learn how complexity improves password security.

## 🪜 Manual Procedure

### Step 1: Created Multiple Passwords
| Type | Sample Password |
|------|------------------|
| Weak | password123 |
| Medium | P@ssword2025 |
| Strong | P@ssW0rd2025! |
| Very Strong | My$ecure#Key2025!@ |
| Passphrase | Mango!Tree#Grows2025 |

---

### Step 2: Used Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols
Examples of variations created and tested:
- `hello123` → weak  
- `Hello@123` → better  
- `H3ll0@2025!` → strong  

---

### Step 3: Tested Passwords on Password Checkers
Used [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com) and [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net)  
to measure password strength and note feedback.

---

### Step 4: Results & Feedback

| Password | Strength/Score | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| password123 | Weak | Few seconds | Too common, add symbols |
| P@ssword2025 | Medium | A few hours | Add more unique characters |
| P@ssW0rd2025! | Strong | Several years | Good use of symbols and mix |
| My$ecure#Key2025!@ | Very Strong | Millions of years | Excellent complexity |
| Mango!Tree#Grows2025 | Very Strong | Billions of years | Great passphrase with mix of cases |

---

## 🔐 Step 5: Identified Best Practices
- Use at least **12 or more characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words or predictable patterns**
- Never reuse passwords across accounts
- Consider **passphrases** (easy to remember, hard to guess)

---

## 🧾 Step 6: Tips Learned
- Mix **letters, numbers, and symbols**
- Use **different cases** (A, a)
- Avoid **personal info** like birthdays or names
- Change passwords regularly
- Use password managers to store them securely
- Example of a good password: `Sun!Rise#At7AM2025`

## ⚔️ Step 7: Common Password Attacks
| Attack Type | Description | Prevention |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force Attack** | Tries all possible combinations until it finds a match | Use long, complex passwords |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a list of common passwords or words | Avoid dictionary-based words |
| **Phishing Attack** | Tricks users into revealing passwords | Never click suspicious links |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked passwords from other sites | Use unique passwords per account |

---

## 🔎 Step 8: Password Complexity and Security
The stronger and longer a password is, the harder it becomes to crack.  
- A **weak password** (like `password123`) can be broken in seconds.  
- A **complex password** (like `My$ecure#Key2025!@`) might take millions of years.  

Password complexity exponentially increases the time and computational power required for attacks.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
This activity helped understand how password strength affects overall security.  
By combining different character types and sufficient length, passwords become resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.  
Passphrases are practical alternatives for strong and memorable passwords.

## 🏁 Outcome
Gained practical knowledge about:
- Password complexity and evaluation  
- Password attack prevention techniques  
- Best practices for secure password creation  
- Importance of length, variety, and unpredictability in passwords
