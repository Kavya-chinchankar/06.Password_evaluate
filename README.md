# 🔒 Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📘 Title
**Password Strength Evaluation and Best Practices**

---

## 🎯 Objective
To create multiple passwords with different complexity levels, evaluate their strength using online tools, and understand how password length and character diversity improve security.

---

## 🧠 Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com)
- [How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net)

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Created 4–5 sample passwords with varying complexity (weak to very strong).  
2. Used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and different lengths.  
3. Tested each password on password strength checkers.  
4. Recorded feedback and strength scores.  
5. Identified best practices for creating secure passwords.  
6. Researched common password attacks and ways to prevent them.  
7. Summarized how password complexity enhances security.

## 📋 Sample Passwords & Results

| Password | Strength | Feedback |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| password123 | Weak | Too common, short, lacks symbols |
| P@ssword2025 | Medium | Good but predictable pattern |
| P@ssW0rd2025! | Strong | Includes numbers and symbols |
| My$ecure#Key2025!@ | Very Strong | Excellent complexity and length |
| Mango!Tree#Grows2025 | Very Strong | Passphrase, long and strong |

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings
- Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.  
- Using a mix of **symbols, numbers, and letters** strengthens security.  
- Avoid common or reused passwords.  
- Password managers and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** increase protection.  
- Use **passphrases** that are memorable yet complex.

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks
| Attack Type | Description | Prevention |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force** | Tries all combinations | Use long and complex passwords |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses common word lists | Avoid predictable words |
| **Phishing** | Tricks users to reveal passwords | Verify links before clicking |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses leaked passwords | Always use unique passwords |

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
Password complexity plays a crucial role in protecting accounts from attacks.  
A mix of **length, randomness, and character diversity** ensures passwords remain resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.

---

## 🏁 Outcome
Successfully learned to:
- Evaluate password strength  
- Understand attack types  
- Apply password creation best practices  
- Build awareness of real-world password security
